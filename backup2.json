Our purposes for using personal information include:\r\n\r\nProvide AWS Offerings: We use your personal information to provide and deliver AWS Offerings and process transactions related to AWS Offerings, including registrations, subscriptions, purchases, and payments.\r\nMeasure, Support, and Improve AWS Offerings: We use your personal information to measure use of, analyze performance of, fix errors in, provide support for, improve, and develop AWS Offerings.\r\nRecommendations and Personalization: We use your personal information to recommend AWS Offerings that might be of interest to you, identify your preferences, and personalize your experience with AWS Offerings.\r\nComply with Legal Obligations: In certain cases, we have a legal obligation to collect, use, or retain your personal information. For example, we collect bank account information from AWS Marketplace sellers for identity verification.\r\nCommunicate with You: We use your personal information to communicate with you in relation to AWS Offerings via different channels (e.g., by phone, email, chat) and to respond to your requests.\r\nMarketing: We use your personal information to market and promote AWS Offerings. We might display interest-based ads for AWS Offerings. To learn more, please read our Interest-Based Ads notice. \r\nFraud and Abuse Prevention and Credit Risks: We use your personal information to prevent and detect fraud and abuse in order to protect the security of our customers, AWS, and others. We may also use scoring methods to assess and manage credit risks.\r\nPurposes for Which We Seek Your Consent: We may also ask for your consent to use your personal information for a specific purpose that we communicate to you.\r\nCookies\r\nTo enable our systems to recognize your browser or device and to provide AWS Offerings, we use cookies. For more information about cookies and how we use them, please read our Cookie Notice.\r\nHow We Share Personal Information\r\nInformation about our customers is an important part of our business and we are not in the business of selling our customers\u2019 personal information to others. We share personal information only as described below and with Amazon.com, Inc. and the subsidiaries that Amazon.com, Inc. controls that are either subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice.\r\n\r\nTransactions Involving Third Parties: We make available to you services, software, and content provided by third parties for use on or through AWS Offerings. You can tell when a third party is involved in your transactions, and we share information related to those transactions with that third party. For example, you can order services, software, and content from sellers using the AWS Marketplace and we provide those sellers information to facilitate your subscription, purchases, or support.\r\nThird-Party Service Providers: We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include: delivering AWS hardware, sending communications, processing payments, assessing credit and compliance risks, analyzing data, providing marketing and sales assistance (including advertising and event management), conducting customer relationship management, and providing training. These third party service providers have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. Further, they must process that information in accordance with this Privacy Notice and as permitted by applicable data protection law.\r\nBusiness Transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or services. In such transactions, personal information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the individual consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that AWS or substantially all of its assets are acquired, your information will of course be one of the transferred assets.\r\nProtection of Us and Others: We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce or apply our terms and other agreements, or protect the rights, property, or security of AWS, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud prevention and detection and credit risk reduction.\r\nAt Your Option: Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when personal information about you might be shared with third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.\r\nLocation of Personal Information\r\nAmazon Web Services, Inc. is located in the United States, and our affiliated companies are located throughout the world.

Our security procedures mean that we may request proof of identity before we disclose personal information to you.\r\nInternet Advertising and Third Parties\r\nAWS Offerings may include third-party advertising and links to other websites and applications.

If you\u2019re under 18, you may use AWS Offerings only with the involvement of a parent or guardian.\r\nRetention of Personal Information\r\nWe keep your personal information to enable your continued use of AWS Offerings, for as long as it is required in order to fulfill the relevant purposes described in this Privacy Notice, as may be required by law (including for tax and accounting purposes), or as otherwise communicated to you. How long we retain specific personal information varies depending on the purpose for its use, and we will delete your personal information in accordance with applicable law.\r\nContacts, Notices, and Revisions\r\nIf you have any concern about privacy at AWS or want to contact one of our data controllers, please contact us with a thorough description, and we will try to resolve the issue for you.
